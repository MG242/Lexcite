**Step 1: Discovery Phase**

**Functionalities:**
LexCite will be a tool that helps legal professionals correctly cite online sources according to the 'Leidraad voor juridische auteurs' (Dutch Legal Citation Guide). The application should offer the following capabilities:

* **Input options:** URLs, manual input of source data.
* **Output formats:** Proper citation formats based on the guide.
* **Validation:** Check for completeness and correctness of the input.
* **Export options:** Generate citations in Word, PDF, or as copyable text.
* **User accounts:** Ability to create profiles and save citations.

**Type of Application:**
LexCite will be a **web application** with a simple and responsive interface. A mobile version may be developed later, based on user demand.

**Visual Design:**

* Minimalist and professional.
* White on dark blue background (as used in the logo design).
* Intuitive interface with no unnecessary complexity.

**Technology Stack:**

* **Frontend:** React.js or Vue.js for a fast and responsive UI.
* **Backend:** Node.js (Express) or Django (Python) for API functionalities.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data storage.
* **Hosting:** AWS, Vercel, or DigitalOcean for scalability.

**Accessibility:**

* Clear, readable fonts.
* Support for screen readers and keyboard navigation.
* Option to adjust contrast settings.

**Budget and Timeline:**

* **Initial costs:** Domain and hosting (€50–€200 per year).
* **Development costs:** Depending on whether freelancers or in-house developers are used (€5,000 – €20,000 for a minimum viable product).
* **Timeline:** First working version within 3–6 months.

**Step 2: Technical Design**

**Interaction Design:**

* User enters a URL or source data via an input screen.
* The application validates the input and generates a correct citation.
* The user can copy, download, or save the generated citation.

**Visual Design:**

* Clean, minimalist dashboard with an input field and real-time citation preview.
* Dark blue background with white and orange accents (matching the logo design).

**Technical Design:**

* API that analyzes incoming URLs and fetches metadata.
* Algorithm that converts metadata into correct legal citations.
* Database for storing user accounts and saved citations.
* Potential future integration with legal databases.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Privacy and security (GDPR-compliant storage of user data).
* Potential partnerships with universities and legal institutions.
